# CIS-137-Lab-3

When this program is started, you will see 24 blue squares. You can click on a square to reveal a flower underneath. There are 12 pairs of flowers. Each time you start the program, the flowers will be in a different order.

Here is a video of the program (The video is too big to be embedded directly unfortunately):
